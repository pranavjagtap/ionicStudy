# Page
A Page is a component which is used as a Page
Every Page is a component but every component is not a Page.
These are full views/screens instead of partials from any view/page.
Partials are be components.
Views are Pages.

We can generate ionic page using cli with below command.
ionic generate page <page-name>

We can even generate pages manually.
We can even nest the pages - which is currently not possible using ionic cli.
